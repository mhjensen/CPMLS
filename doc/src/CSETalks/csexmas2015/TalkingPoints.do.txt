TITLE: Master program in Computational Science  at the University of Oslo
AUTHOR: Morten Hjorth-Jensen at Department of Physics, University of Oslo

DATE: Planned start: Fall 2018

===== Strategic importance =====

The program will educate the next generation of cross-disciplinary
science students with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to pose
and solve current and new scientific, technological and societal
challenges. The program will lay the foundation for cross-disciplinary
educational, research and innovation activities.

It is the first educational program to
comprehensively treat computation as the *triple junction* of
algorithm development and analysis, high performance computing, and
applications to scientific and engineering modeling and data
science. This approach recognizes computation as a new discipline
rather than being decentralized into isolated sub-disciplines. The CS program
will  will enable application-driven computational modeling
while also exposing disciplinary computational scientists to
advanced tools and techniques, which will ignite new
transformational connections in research and education.

===== Vision for the future: Scientific Computing and Data Science =====

Scientific computing focuses on the development of predictive computer
models of the world around us. As study of physical phenomena through
experimentation has become impossible, impractical and/or expensive,
computational modeling has become the primary tool for
understanding—equal in stature to analysis and experiment. 
The discipline of scientific computing
is the development of new methods that make challenging problems
tractable on modern computing platforms, providing scientists and
engineers with key windows into the world around us.

Data science focuses on the development of tools designed to find
trends within datasets that help scientists who are challenged with
massive amounts of data to assess key relations within those
datasets. These key relations provide hooks that allow scientists to
identify models which, in turn, facilitate making accurate predictions
in complex systems. For example, a key data science goal on the
biological side would be better care for patients (e.g., personalized
medicine). Given a patient’s genetic makeup, the proper data-driven
model would identify the most effective treatment for that patient.

===== Aims of the program =====


A specific aim of this program is to develop the students' ability to pose and
solve problems that combine physical insights with mathematical tools
and computational skills. This provides a unique combination
of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable
for the development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs.
The main focus is not to educate computer
specialists, but to educate students with a solid understanding in basic science
as well as an integrated knowledge on how  to use
essential methods from computational science. This requires an
education that covers both the specific disciplines like physics, biology,
geoscience, mathematics etc with a strong background in computational science.


A significant aspect of this program is the ability to offer new educational
opportunities that are aligned with the needs of a 21st century
workforce. Many companies are seeking
individuals who have knowledge of both a specific discipline and
computational modeling.

===== Thesis directions, as of October 17 2016 =====
!bblock

* Computational Science: Astrophysics
* Computational Science: Bioscience
* Computational Science: Chemistry
* Computational Science: Finance and Risk Analysis
* Computational Science: Imaging and Biomedical Computing
* Computational Science: Materials science
* Computational Science: Mathematics
* Computational Science: Mechanics
* Computational Science: Physics

_The Bioscience direction may change to Biology and Bioinformatics with an emphasis on applied bioinformatics for the latter. The university of Oslo is lagging strongly behind NTNU and UMB when it comes to offering studies in bioinformatics and computational biology. Our inertia here can cause serious  long-term recruitment problems in such rapidly growing fields.
For Bioinformatics we need to clarify the distribution of roles between the CS program and the Data Science program._

The Department of Mathematics may merge the study directions Mathematics and Finance and Risk Analysis to one direction, _Mathematics and Risk_.  The Mechanics direction remains as it is.

We are awaiting inputs from Steinar Holden at the Department of Economy.

===== Required courses  =====
!bblock
In order to build a common study program and identity as a Computational Science student, there will be two compulsory courses that aim at providing topics of common and broad interest.
Both courses have a workload of 10 ECTS each. The courses are

* _CS1_: *High-Performance Computing and Numerical projects*, 10 ECTS
  o This course teaches you to develop and structure large numerical projects, from code writing to  finalizing a report
  o Topics which are included are parallelization and vectorization (content overlap with  INF3380)
  o Machine architecture and GPU-CPU programming
  o Optimization of code and benchmarking
  o Numerical methods from linear algebra will be discussed as well as examples from life science.
* _CS2_: *Data analysis and machine learning*, 10 ECTS
  o Monte Carlo methods and statistical data analysis (potential overlap with STK2100)
  o Optimization of data and handling of large data sets  (potential overlap with STK2100)
  o Machine learning and neural networks (New course at IFI)

We expect collaborations between several departments in building up these courses.
The courses _CS1_ and _CS2_ are courses of interest to  many departments at UiO.

===== Admission critera =====
!bblock
The following higher education entrance qualifications are needed

* A completed bachelor's degree (undergraduate) comparable to a Norwegian bachelor's degree in one of the following disciplines
  o Biology, molecular biology, biochemistry  or any life science degree
  o Physics, astrophysics, astronomy, geophysics and meteorology
  o Mathematics, mechanics, statistics and computational mathematics
  o Computer science and electronics
  o Chemistry
  o Materials Science and nanotechnology
  o Any undergraduate degree in engineering
  o Mathematical finance and economy
  o Economy
* For international students, an internationally recognised English language proficiency test is required.

The above undergraduate degrees have some minimal requirements on
specializations which need to be fulfilled.  In addition to the above
required undergraduate degrees, students need to have 40 ECTS in basic
undergraduate mathematics and programming courses (calculus, linear
algebra and/or mathematical modeling and programming). A course in
programming is compulsory and should correspond at least to 10 ECTS
of work load.  The average mark for the mathematics and programming
courses, as well as 40 ECTS in senior undergraduate courses (2000 and
3000 level in Norway) for the specific specialization has at least to
be C (letter marks).  As an example, an undergraduate degree in
Chemistry has a minimal requirement on chemistry courses, typically
amounting to at least 60 ECTS out of 180 ECTS for a bachelor's
degree. The average mark on the 40 ECTS of selected senior
undergraduate credits in chemistry and the 40 ECTS in mathematics and
programming should at least be C.

_For the Bioscience, Mathematics, Finance and Risk Analysis, Mechanics and Imaging and Biomedical Computing there will be additional constraints on the 2000 and 3000 courses included in the 40 ECTS. These will specified soon._
