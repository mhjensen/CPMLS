===== Some overarching inputs to guide(misguide) the discussion =====
!bblock
We need to develop an identity for the program (and your ownership of the program). 
It is meant to be a multidisciplinary program. It is not a math, or chemistry or physics program. In recruiting there will be obvious and less obvious sociological barriers which may influence the way students (and our colleagues) perceive this MSc program. The discussions today aim at identifying and find solutions to some of these problems, namely
 * Discussing the learning outcomes in more detail as well as reviewing the online description of the program (like overarching description of the program)
 * Courses/modules to be developed  and cost analysis when sharing courses
 * Defining MSc thesis directions and pool of potential teachers

===== Timeline and outcomes =====

What should the outcome(s) of this meeting be? 
 o Timeline and working groups for revising the text on learning outcomes etc
 o Timeline and working groups for modules, courses and MSc thesis directions/projects/teachers

===== Master program in Computational Physics, Mathematics and Life Science =====
!bblock

The program is a collaboration between five departments and classical disciplines:

 * Department of Biosciences
 * Department of Chemistry
 * Department of Informatics
 * Department of Mathematics
 * Department of Physics

The program is multidisciplinary and all students who have completed
undergraduate studies in science and engineering, with a sufficient
quantitative background, are eligible.

===== Structure and courses =====
!bblock
The table here is an example of a suggested path for a Master of Science project,
with course work the first year and thesis work the last year.

|--------l------------------l----------------------l---------------l-------------|
|                   |  10 ECTS           |  10 ECTS     |       10 ECTS          |
|--------l------------------l----------------------l----------------l------------|
| 4th semester      | Master thesis      |   Master Thesis  | Master Thesis      |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3rd semester      | Master thesis      |   Master Thesis  | Master Thesis      |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2nd semester      | Master courses      |   Master courses  | Master courses   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1st semester      | Master courses      |   Master courses  | Master courses   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

The program is very flexible in its structure and students may opt for starting with their thesis
work from the first semester and scatter the respective course load across all four semesters.
Depending on interests and specializations, there are many courses on computational science which can make
up the required curriculum of course work. Furthermore, courses may be broken up in smaller modules,
avoding thereby the limitation of 10 ECTS per course only. Some of these courses are listed below.

===== Structure and specialized modules  =====
!bblock
The program allows also for replacing regular courses with specialized modules of shorter duration.
These modules will be developed by the program committee but can also be developed in an ad hoc basis
and tailored to the individual projects. Specialized modules can amount to up to the full course requirement of 60 ECTS.


|--------l------------------l----------------------l---------------l-------------|
|                   |  10 ECTS           |  10 ECTS     |       10 ECTS          |
|--------l------------------l----------------------l----------------l------------|
| 4th semester      | Master thesis      |   Master Thesis  | Master Thesis      |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3rd semester      | Master thesis      |   Master Thesis  | Master Thesis      |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2nd semester      | Special module      |   Special module  | Special module   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1st semester      | Special module      |   Special module  | Special module   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

The above set up shows how courses may be broken up in smaller modules.
