<h2 id="___sec0">Master program in Computational Physics, Mathematics and Life Science </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
We propose a new Master of Science program at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the University of Oslo. This program is called  <b>Computational Physics, Mathematics and Life Science</b>, with acronym  <b>CPMLS</b>

<p>
The program is a collaboration between four departments and classical disciplines:

<ul>
 <p><li> Department of Biosciences</li>
 <p><li> Department of Informatics</li>
 <p><li> Department of Mathematics</li>
 <p><li> Department of Physics</li>
</ul>
<p>

The program will be administrated by the Department of Physics. 
The program is based on the highly successful Computational Physics direction under the present Master program
in physics at the University of Oslo.

<p>
The program is multidisciplinary and all students who have completed
undergraduate studies in science and engineering, with a sufficient
quantitative background, are eligible.  The language of instruction is
English.
</div>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec1">Strategic importance </h2>

<p>
The program will educate the next generation of cross-disciplinary
science students with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to pose
and solve current and new scientific, technological and societal
challenges. The program will lay the foundation for cross-disciplinary
educational, research and innovation activities at the Faculty. The
program will contribute to building a common cross-disciplinary
approach to the key strategic initiatives at the Faculty: Energy,
Materials, Life Science, and Enabling Technologies.

<p>
A particular strength of physics students is their ability to pose and
solve problems that combine physical insights with mathematical tools
and now also computational skills. This provides a unique combination
of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable 
for the development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs. 
In this program we build on and
refine this philosophy.  The main focus is not to educate computer
specialists, but to educate students with a solid understanding in basic science
as well as an integrated knowledge on how  to use 
essential methods from computational science. This requires an
education that covers both the specific disciplines likephysics, biology,
geoscience, mathematics etcwith a strong background in computational science.
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec2">Scientific and educational motivation </h2>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>Applications of simulation.</b>
<p>
Numerical simulations of various systems in science are central to our
basic understanding of nature and technlogy.
The increase in computational power,
improved algorithms for solving problems in science as well as access
to high-performance facilities, allow researchers nowadays to study
complicated systems across many length and energy scales. Applications
span from studying quantum physical systems in nanotechnology and the
characteristics of new materials or subamotic physics at its smallest
length scale, to simulating galaxies and the evolution of the universe.
In between, simulations are key to understanding
cancer treatment and how the brain works,
predicting climate changes and this week's weather,
simulating natural disasters, semi-conductor devices,
quantum computers, as well as assessing risk in the insurance and
financial industry. These are just a few topics
already well covered at the University of Oslo and that can be
topics for coming thesis projects as well as research directions.
</div>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>Job market.</b>
<p>
A large number of the candidates from the four involved departments
get jobs where numerical simulations are central and essential. The proposed
program will raise the educational quality in this area, because
our candidates need a broader understanding of the possibilities
and limitations of computation-based problem solving.
</div>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec3">Multiscale modeling is the big open research question </h2>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Today's problems, unlike traditional
science and engineering, involve complex systems with many distinct
physical processes. The wide open research topic of this century, both
in industry and at universities, is how to effectively couple
processes across different length and energy scales. Progress will
rely on a multi-disciplinary approach and therefore a need for
a multi-disciplinary educational program.
</div>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
The proposed program will foster candidates with the right
multi-disciplinary background and comutational thinking for
understanding today's simulation technology and its challenges.
</div>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec4">The new program combines old and new initiatives </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
This program builds on the strengths and successes of two existing master's
programs in Computational Physics (at the Dept. of Physics) and
Applied Mathematics and Mechanics (at the Dept. of Mathematics).

<p>
A new master's program in Computational Life must anyway be developed to
meet coming needs of the scientific community. If successful, it will
position the University of Oslo as the leading institution
nationally in computational life science. We belive this new program is
best developed in close collaboration with already successful
computational science programs.

<p>
The program in Computational Life Sciences will have a strong
link to the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. Further links to
NTNU will be developed.
</div>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec5">Computational Physics at UiO has been a great success </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
This initiative has its roots in the highly successful direction called <a href="http://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/physics-master/programme-options/computational/index.html" target="_blank">Computational Physics</a>
under the Master program in Physics at the University of Oslo.

<p>
This program has educated almost 60 Master of Science students during
the last ten years.  Over 50% of these students have continued with
PhD studies in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and now recently
Biology connected with the CINPLA project.


</div>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec6">The new program will also host the CSE project </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
The new proposed program will also take a leading responsibility in further
developments of the highly successful <a href="http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/" target="_blank">Computing in Science Education</a> initiative at UiO.

<p>
If the program becomes successful, it will naturally lead to
new cross-disciplonary research and a need for a new department
in computational science.
</div>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec7">Learning outcomes </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Students of this program learn to use the computer as a laboratory for solving problems in science and engineering. The program offers exciting thesis projects from many disciplines: biology and life science, chemistry, mathematics, informatics, physics, geophysics, mechanics, geology  &#8211; the students choose their  field according to their own interests.
</div>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
A Master&#8217;s degree from this program gives the student  a
methodical training in planning, conducting, and reporting large research
projects, often together with other students and university
teachers. Projects usually emphasise finding practical solutions,
developing an intuitive understanding of the science and the
scientific methods needed to solve complicated problems, use of many
tools, and not least developing your own creativity and independent
thinking. The thesis work is a scientific project where the students learn to
tackle a scientific problem in a professional manner.
</div>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec8">Structure and courses </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
The table here is an example of a suggested path for a Master of Science project,
with course work the first year and thesis work the last year.

<p>
<table border="1">

</table>
<p>
The program is very flexible in its structure and students may opt for starting with their thesis
work from the first semester and scatter the respective course load across all four semesters.

<p>
Depending on interests and specializations, there are many courses on computational science which can make
up the required curriculum of course work. Furthermore, courses may be broken up in smaller modules,
avoding thereby the limitation of 10 ECTS per course only. Some of these courses are listed below.

</ul>
</div>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec11">The program opens up for flexible backgrounds  </h2>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
While discipline-based master's programs tend to introduce very strict
requirements to courses, we believe in adapting a computational thesis
topic to the student's background, thereby opening up for
students with a wide range of bachelor's degrees.
A very heterogeneous student community is thought to be a strength and
unique feature of the new program.
</div>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec12">Study abroad and international collaborators </h2>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Students at the University of Oslo may choose to take part of
their degrees at a university abroad.

<p>
Students in this program have a number of interesting international
exchange possibilities. The involved researchers have extensive
collaborations with other researchers worldwide. These exchange
possibility range from top universities in the USA, Asia and Europe as
well as leading National Laboratories in the USA.  
<!-- Students may select Ato take all or part of their degree abroad. -->
</div>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec13">Career prospects </h2>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems students learn
when working on their thesis projects are very similar to the methods
they will use in later stages of their careers.  To handle large
numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical
skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This
knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market.

<p>
Career opportunities are many, from research institutes, universities
and university colleges and a multitude of companies. Examples
include IBM, Hydro, Statoil, and Telenor.  The program gives an
excellent background for further studies, with a PhD as one possible
goal.

<p>
The program has also a strong international element which allows students to
gain important experience from international collaborations in
science, with the opportunity to spend parts of the time spent on 
thesis work at research institutions abroad.
