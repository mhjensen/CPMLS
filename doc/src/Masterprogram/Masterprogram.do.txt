===== Master program in Computational Physics, Mathematics and Life Science =====
!bblock
We propose a new Master of Science program at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the University of Oslo. This program is called  _Computational Physics, Mathematics and Life Science_, with acronym  _CS_


The program is a collaboration between five departments and classical disciplines:

 * Department of Biosciences
 * Department of Chemistry
 * Department of Informatics
 * Department of Mathematics
 * Department of Physics

The program will be administrated by the Department of Physics.
The program is based on the highly successful Computational Physics direction under the present Master program
in Physics at the University of Oslo.

The program is multidisciplinary and all students who have completed
undergraduate studies in science and engineering, with a sufficient
quantitative background, are eligible.  The language of instruction is
English.



!eblock

!split
===== Strategic importance =====

The program will educate the next generation of cross-disciplinary
science students with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to pose
and solve current and new scientific, technological and societal
challenges. The program will lay the foundation for cross-disciplinary
educational, research and innovation activities at the Faculty. The
program will contribute to building a common cross-disciplinary
approach to the key strategic initiatives at the Faculty: Energy,
Materials, Life Science, and Enabling Technologies.

A specific aim of this program is to develop the students' ability to pose and
solve problems that combine physical insights with mathematical tools
and computational skills. This provides a unique combination
of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable
for the development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs.
The main focus is not to educate computer
specialists, but to educate students with a solid understanding in basic science
as well as an integrated knowledge on how  to use
essential methods from computational science. This requires an
education that covers both the specific disciplines like physics, biology,
geoscience, mathematics etc with a strong background in computational science.

To build up an activity in computational life science would naturally bring in colleagues from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences,
adding to this axis their year long experiences.
The program could thus be a dual collaboration between the University of Oslo and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, with eventual
double Master of Science degree agreements.

!split
===== Scientific and educational motivation =====

!bblock Applications of simulation
Numerical simulations of various systems in science are central to our
basic understanding of nature and technlogy.
The increase in computational power,
improved algorithms for solving problems in science as well as access
to high-performance facilities, allow researchers nowadays to study
complicated systems across many length and energy scales. Applications
span from studying quantum physical systems in nanotechnology and the
characteristics of new materials or subamotic physics at its smallest
length scale, to simulating galaxies and the evolution of the universe.
In between, simulations are key to understanding
cancer treatment and how the brain works,
predicting climate changes and this week's weather,
simulating natural disasters, semi-conductor devices,
quantum computers, as well as assessing risk in the insurance and
financial industry. These are just a few topics
already well covered at the University of Oslo and that can be
topics for coming thesis projects as well as research directions.
!eblock

!bblock Job market
A large number of the candidates from the five involved departments
get jobs where numerical simulations are central and essential. The proposed
program will raise the educational quality in this area, because
our candidates need a broader understanding of the possibilities
and limitations of computation-based problem solving.
!eblock

!split
===== Multiscale modeling is a big open research question =====

!bblock
Today's problems, unlike traditional
science and engineering, involve complex systems with many distinct
physical processes. The wide open research topic of this century, both
in industry and at universities, is how to effectively couple
processes across different length and energy scales. Progress will
rely on a multi-disciplinary approach and therefore a need for
a multi-disciplinary educational program.
!eblock

!bblock
The proposed program will foster candidates with the right
multi-disciplinary background and computational thinking for
understanding today's simulation technology and its challenges.
!eblock


!split
===== The new program combines old and new initiatives =====
!bblock

This program builds on the strengths and successes of two existing Master of Science directions at the University of Oslo, namely the 
programs in Computational Physics (at the Dept. of Physics) and
Applied Mathematics and Mechanics (at the Dept. of Mathematics).
These programs were established in 2003.
Based on the experience from these programs, the hope is that the proposed program can enlarge the reach of disciplines where computations play and/or are expected to play  a large. In particular, new directions 
in Computational Life Science need to  be developed to
meet coming needs of the scientific community. We believe this new direction is
best developed in close collaboration with already successful
computational science programs.  In particular, we believe that there are strong synergy effects between the University of Oslo and the Norwegian 
University of Life Sciences in the field of Computational Life Science.

!eblock


!split
===== Computational Physics at UiO has been a great success =====
!bblock

This initiative has its roots in the highly successful direction called "Computational Physics":"http://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/physics-master/programme-options/computational/index.html"
under the Master program in Physics at the University of Oslo.

This program has educated almost 60 Master of Science students during
the last ten years.  Over 50% of these students have continued with
PhD studies in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and now recently
Biology connected with the CINPLA project.

The Computational Physics Master program recieved in 2015 the University of Oslo Educational Award.

!eblock

!split
===== The new program will also host the CSE project =====
!bblock

The new proposed program will also take a leading responsibility in further
developments of the highly successful "Computing in Science Education":"http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/" initiative at UiO.  Master of science thesis projects linked up to the CSE project will be offered.

If the program becomes successful, it will naturally lead to
new cross-disciplinary research and a need for a new department
in computational science.
!eblock


!split
===== Computing competence =====
!bblock
Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers
numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about
developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing
algorithmic thinking when solving problems.  Computing competence has
always been a central part of the science and engineering
education.

Modern computing competence is about

* derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms
* understanding what can go wrong with algorithms
* overview of important, known algorithms
* understanding how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems
* reproducible science and ethics
* algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems
!eblock

!split
===== Key elements in computing competence =====
!bblock
The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem
as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying
general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a
general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of
computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or
numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This
generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for
understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a
particular problem.


Computing competence represents a central element
in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to
essentially almost all advanced problems in modern
societies. Computing competence is simply central to further
progress. It enlarges the body of tools available to students and
scientists beyond classical tools and allows for a more generic
handling of problems. Focusing on algorithmic aspects results in
deeper insights about scientific problems.

Today's projects in science and industry tend to involve larger teams. Tools for reliable collaboration must therefore be mastered (e.g., version control systems, automated computer experiments for reproducibility, software and method documentation).
!eblock

!split
===== Overarching description of the CPMLS program  =====
!bblock
Students of this program learn to use the computer as a laboratory for
solving problems in science and engineering. The program offers
exciting thesis projects from many disciplines: biology and life
science, chemistry, mathematics, informatics, physics, geophysics,
mechanics, geology, computational finance, computational informatics, b
ig data analysis, digital signal processing
and image analysis – the candidates select research field according to
their interests.

A Master’s degree from this program gives the candidate a methodical
training in planning, conducting, and reporting large research
projects, often together with other students and university teachers.
THe projects emphasize finding practical solutions, developing an
intuitive understanding of the science and the scientific methods
needed to solve complicated problems, use of many tools, and not least
developing own creativity and independent thinking. The thesis
work is a scientific project where the candidates learn to tackle a
scientific problem in a professional manner.   The program aims also at
developing a deep understanding of the role of computing in solving modern scientific
problems. A candidate from this program gains  deep insights in the fundamnetal role
computations play  in our advancement of science and technology, as well as the role computations play  in society.

===== Structure and courses =====
!bblock
The table here is an example of a suggested path for a Master of Science project,
with course work the first year and thesis work the last year.

|--------l------------------l----------------------l---------------l-------------|
|                   |  10 ECTS           |  10 ECTS     |       10 ECTS          |

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

The program is very flexible in its structure and students may opt for starting with their thesis
work from the first semester and scatter the respective course load across all four semesters.
Depending on interests and specializations, there are many courses on computational science which can make
up the required curriculum of course work. Furthermore, courses may be broken up in smaller modules,
avoding thereby the limitation of 10 ECTS per course only. Some of these courses are listed below.
!eblock

!split
===== Structure and specialized modules  =====
!bblock
The program allows also for replacing regular courses with specialized modules of shorter duration.
These modules will be developed by the program committee but can also be developed in an ad hoc basis
and tailored to the individual projects. Specialized modules can amount to up to the full course requirement of 60 ECTS.


|--------l------------------l----------------------l---------------l-------------|
|                   |  10 ECTS           |  10 ECTS     |       10 ECTS          |

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1st semester      | Special module      |   Special module  | Special module   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

The above set up shows how courses may be broken up in smaller modules.

!split
===== Thesis directions =====
!bblock
The program aims at offering thesis projects in a variety of fields. The scientists involved in this program can offer thesis
topics that cover several disciplines. These are

* Computational mathematics
* Computational mechanics and fluid mechanics 
* Computational chemistry
* Computational physics
* Computational materials science
* Computational life science
* Computational informatics
* Image analysis and signal processing
* Computational finance and statistics 
* Computational geoscience

The thesis projects will be tailored to the student's needs, wishes and scientific background. The projects can easily incorporate topics from more than one discipline.
!eblock






!split
===== The program opens up for flexible backgrounds  =====

!bblock
While discipline-based master's programs tend to introduce very strict
requirements to courses, we believe in adapting a computational thesis
topic to the student's background, thereby opening up for
students with a wide range of bachelor's degrees.
A very heterogeneous student community is thought to be a strength and
unique feature of this program.
!eblock

!split
===== Study abroad and international collaborators =====

!bblock

Students at the University of Oslo may choose to take parts of
their degrees at a university abroad.

Students in this program have a number of interesting international
exchange possibilities. The involved researchers have extensive
collaborations with other researchers worldwide. These exchange
possibility range from top universities in the USA, Asia and Europe as
well as leading National Laboratories in the USA.

!eblock

!split
===== Career prospects =====

!bblock
Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems students learn
when working on their thesis projects are very similar to the methods
they will use in later stages of their careers.  To handle large
numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical
skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This
knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market.

Career opportunities are many, from research institutes, universities
and university colleges and a multitude of companies. Examples
include IBM, Hydro, Statoil, and Telenor.  The program gives an
excellent background for further studies, with a PhD as one possible
goal.

The program has also a strong international element which allows students to
gain important experience from international collaborations in
science, with the opportunity to spend parts of the time spent on
thesis work at research institutions abroad.
