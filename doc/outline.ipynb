      "Simulations that couple multiple physical phenomena are\n",

      "increasing computational capability and greater aspirations\n",
      "for simulation in domains of scientific prediction, engineering\n",
      "design, and policy making.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of particular importance for technological advances in fields as varied as materials science and life science, or subatomic physics, is the capability to study and model physical phenomena across scales, what is normally called multiscale science.\n",
      "Today's problems, unlike traditional science and engineering, do not  involve physical processes covered by the single traditional discipline of say physics or the associated mathematics. Complex and real systems encountered  in virtually all applications of interest involve many distinct physical processes. \n",
      "The issue of coupling models of different events at different scales (length or energy) and governed by different physical laws is largely wide open and represents an enormously challenging area for future research and technological advances.  Tackling problems from multiscale science requires multi disciplinarity as well.\n",

      "This program aims  at preparing the next generation of scientists enabling them to tackle the many challenges posed by understanding physical processes across many scales. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since this requires cooperations between many disciplines, a program\n",
      "which involves several departments is needed. Furthermore, this\n",
      "program aims at developing a master's program in Computational Life\n",
      "Science in order to meet the coming needs of the scientific community. If successful, it will\n",
      "position the University of Oslo as the leading institution\n",
      "nationally in computational life science and computational science in general. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to collaborations across disciplines at the University of Oslo, \n",
