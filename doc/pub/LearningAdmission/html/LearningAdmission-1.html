<p>
Students of this program learn to use the computer as a laboratory for
solving problems in science and engineering. The program offers
exciting thesis projects from many disciplines: biology and life
science, chemistry, mathematics, informatics, physics, geophysics,
mechanics, geology, computational finance, computational informatics, bid data analysis, digital signal processing
and image analysis &#8211; the candidates select research field according to
their interests.

<p>
A Master&#8217;s degree from this program gives the candidate a methodical
training in planning, conducting, and reporting large research
projects, often together with other students and university teachers.
THe projects emphasize finding practical solutions, developing an
intuitive understanding of the science and the scientific methods
needed to solve complicated problems, use of many tools, and not least
developing own creativity and independent thinking. The thesis
work is a scientific project where the candidates learn to tackle a
scientific problem in a professional manner.   The program aims also at 
developing a deep understanding of the role of computing in solving modern scientific
problems. A candidate from this program gains  deep insights in the fundamnetal role 
computations play  in our advancement of science and technology, as well as the role computations play  in society.

<p>
The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem
as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying
general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a
general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of
computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or
numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This
generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for
understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a
particular problem.

<p>
Computing competence represents a central element
in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to
essentially almost all advanced problems in modern
societies. Computing competence is simply central to further
progress. It enlarges the body of tools available to students and
scientists beyond classical tools and allows for a more generic
handling of problems. Focusing on algorithmic aspects results in
deeper insights about scientific problems.

<h2 id="___sec2">Admission critera </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">

<p>
The following higher education entrance qualifications are needed

<ul>
<li> A completed bachelor's degree (undergraduate) comparable to a Norwegian bachelor's degree in one of the following disciplines</li>

<ol>
 <li> Biology, molecular biology, biochemistry  or any life science degree</li>
 <li> Physics, astrophysics, astronomy, geophysics and meteorology</li>
 <li> Mathematics, mechanics, statistics and computational mathematics</li>
 <li> Computer science and electronics</li>
 <li> Chemistry</li>
 <li> Materials Science and nanotechnology</li>
 <li> Any undergraduate degree in engineering</li>
 <li> Mathematical finance and economy</li>
 <li> Economy</li>
</ol>

<li> For international students, an internationally recognised English language proficiency test is required.</li>
</ul>

The above undergraduate degrees have some minimal requirements on specializations which need to be fulfilled.  In addition to the above required undergraduate degrees, students need to have 40 ECTS in basic undergraduate mathematics and programming courses (calculus, linear algebra and/or mathematical modeling and programming). A course in programming is compulsory. 
The average mark for the mathematics and programming courses, as well as 40 ECTS in  senior undergraduate courses (2000 and 3000 level in Norway) for the specific specialization  has at least to be C (letter marks). 
As an example, an undergraduate degree in Chemistry has a minimal requirement on chemistry courses, typically amounting to at least 60 ECTS out of 180 ECTS for a bachelor's degree. The average mark on the 40 ECTS  of selected senior undergraduate credits in chemistry and the 40 ECTS in mathematics and programming should
at least be C,
