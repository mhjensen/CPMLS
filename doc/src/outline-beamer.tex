\frametitle{Master program in Computational Physics, Mathematics and Life Science}

\begin{block}{}
We propose a new Master of Science program at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the University of Oslo. This program is called  \textbf{Computational Physics, Mathematics and Life Science}, with acronym  \textbf{CPMLS} 
% ('Computational ... Scienceææ).

The program is a collaboration between four departments and classical disciplines:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Department of Biosciences

 \item Department of Informatics

 \item Department of Mathematics

 \item Department of Physics
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The program will be administrated by the Department of Physics. 
The program is based on the highly successful Computational Physics direction under the present Master program
in physics at the University of Oslo.

The program is multidisciplinary and all students who have completed undergraduate studies in science and enginereeing, with a sufficient quantitative background, are eligible.  The language of instruction is English.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{Strategic importance}

The program will educate the next generation of cross-disciplinary science students with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to pose and solve current and new scientific, technological and societal challenges. The program will lay the foundation for cross-disciplinary educational, research and innovation activities at the Faculty. The program will contribute to building a common cross-disciplinary approach to the key strategic initiatives at the Faculty: Energy, Materials, Life Science, and Enabling Technologies. 

A particular strength of physics students have traditionally been their ability to pose and solve problems that combine physical insights with mathematical tools and now also computational skills. This provides a unique combination of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills, which have allows the studies to be of use across field. In this program, we build on and refine this philosophy.  The main focus is not to educate computer specialists, but to educate students with specilized knowledge and skills in a field, but with an integrated knowledge of how computational methods are used as part of that field. This requires an education that covers both the subject field --- physics, biology, geoscience --- with a strong background in computational methods.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{Scientific and educational motivation}

\begin{block}{Applications of simulation }
Numerical simulations of various systems in science are central to our
basic understanding of nature and technlogy.
The increase in computational power,
improved algorithms for solving problems in science as well as access
to high-performance facilities, allow researchers nowadays to study
complicated systems across many length and energy scales. Applications
span from studying quantum physical systems in nanotechnology and the
characteristics of new materials or subamotic physics at its smallest
length scale, to simulating galaxies and the creation of the universe.
In between, simulations are key to understanding
cancer treatment and how the brain works,
predicting climate changes and this week's weather,
simulating natural disasters, semi-conductor devices,
quantum computers, as well as assessing risk in the insurance and
financial industry. These are just a few topics
already well covered at the University of Oslo and that can be
topics for a thesis.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Job market }
A large number of the candidates from the four involved departments
get jobs where numerical simulations play a key tool. The proposed
program will raise the educational quality in this area, because
our candidates need a broader understanding of the possibilities
and limitations of computation-based problem solving.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{Multiscale modeling is the big open research question}

\begin{block}{}
Today's problems, unlike traditional
science and engineering, involve complex systems with many distinct
physical processes. The wide open research topic of this century, both
in industry and at universities, is how to effectively couple
processes across different length and energy scales. Progress will
rely on a multi-disciplinary approach and therefore a need for
a multi-disciplinary educational program.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{}
The proposed program will foster candidates with the right
multi-disciplinary background and comutational thinking for
understanding today's simulation technology and its challenges.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{The new program combines old and new initiatives}

\begin{block}{}

This program builds on the strengths and success of two existing master's
programs in Computational Physics (at the Dept.~of Physics) and
Applied Mathematics and Mechanics (at the Dept.~of Mathematics).

A new master's program in Computational Life must anyway be developed to
meet coming needs of the scientific community. If successful, it will
position the University of Oslo as the leading institution
nationally in computational life science. We belive this new program is
best developed in close collaboration with already successful
computational science programs.

The program in Computational Life Sciences will have a strong
link to the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. Further links to
NTNU will be developed.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{Computational Physics at UiO has been a great success}

\begin{block}{}

This initiative has its roots in the highly successful direction called \href{{http://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/physics-master/programme-options/computational/index.html}}{Computational Physics}
under the Master program in Physics at the University of Oslo.

This program has educated almost 60 Master of Science students during
the last ten years.  Over 50\% of these students have continued with
PhD studies in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and now recently
Biology connected with the CINPLA project.

Say something about the Applied Math program too...
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{The new program will also host the CSE project}

\begin{block}{}

The new proposed program will also take a leading responsibility in further
developments of the highly successful \href{{http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/}}{Computing in Science Education} initiative at UiO.

If the program becomes successful, it will naturally lead to
new cross-disciplonary research and a need for a new department
in computational science.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{Learning outcomes}

\begin{block}{}
Students of this program learn to use the computer as a laboratory for solving problems in science and engineering. The program offers exciting thesis projects from many disciplines: biology and life science, chemistry, mathematics, informatics, physics, geophysics, mechanics, geology  – you choose your  field according to your own interests.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{}
A Master’s degree from this program gives you a
methodical training in planning, conducting, and reporting large research
projects, often together with other students and university
teachers. Projects usually emphasise finding practical solutions,
developing an intuitive understanding of the science and the
scientific methods needed to solve complicated problems, use of many
tools, and not least developing your own creativity and independent
thinking. Your thesis work is a scientific project where you learn to
tackle a scientific problem in a professional manner.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{Structure and courses}

\begin{block}{}
The table here is an example of a suggested path for a Master of Science project,
with course work the first year and thesis work the last year.


{\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{l}{  } & \multicolumn{1}{l}{ 10 ECTS } & \multicolumn{1}{l}{ 10 ECTS } & \multicolumn{1}{l}{ 10 ECTS } \\
\hline
4th semester & Master thesis  & Master Thesis  & Master Thesis  \\
\hline
3rd semester & Master thesis  & Master Thesis  & Master Thesis  \\
\hline
2nd semester & Master courses & Master courses & Master courses \\
\hline
1st semester & Master courses & Master courses & Master courses \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
}

\noindent
The program is very flexible in its structure and students may opt for starting with their thesis
work from the first semester and scatter the respective course load across all four semesters.

Depending on interests and specializations, there are many courses on computational science which can make
up the required curriculum of course work. Furthermore, courses may be broken up in smaller modules,
avoding thereby the limitation of 10 ECTS per course only. Some of these courses are listed below.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{Structure}

\begin{block}{}
Here follows a list of suggested courses that students may include in their required course load.

\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{Admission}

\begin{block}{}
The following higher education entrance qualifications are needed

\begin{itemize}
\item A completed bachelor's degree (undergraduate) comparable to a Norwegian bachelor's degree in one of the following disciplines
\begin{enumerate}

 \item Biology, molecular biology, biochemistry  or any life science degree

 \item Physics, astrophysics, astronomy, geophysics and meteorology

 \item Mathematics, mechanics, statistics and computational mathematics

 \item Computer science and electronics

 \item Chemistry

 \item Materials Science and nanotechnology

 \item Any undergraduate degree in engineering

 \item Mathematical finance and economy

\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\item The language of instruction is English. An internationally recognised English language proficiency test is required.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{The program opens up for flexible backgrounds}

\begin{block}{}
While discipline-based master's programs tend to introduce very strict
requirements to courses, we believe in adapting a computational thesis
topic to the student's background, thereby opening up for
students with a wide range of bachelor's degrees.
A very heterogeneous student community is thought to be a strength and
unique feature of the new program.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{Study abroad and international collaborators}

\begin{block}{}

As a student at the University of Oslo you may choose to take part of
your degree at a university abroad.

Students in this program have a number of interesting international
exchange possibilities. The involved researchers have extensive
collaborations with other researchers worldwide. These exchange
possibility range from top universities in the USA, Asia and Europe as
well as leading National Laboratories in the USA.  
% Students may select Ato take all or part of their degree abroad.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{Career prospects}

\begin{block}{}
Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems you learn
when working on your thesis project are very similar to the methods
you will use in later stages of your career.  To handle large
numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical
skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This
knowledge makes you unique on the labor market.

Career opportunities are many, from research institutes, universities
and university colleges and a multitude of companies. Examples
include IBM, Hydro, Statoil, and Telenor.  The program gives you an
excellent background for further studies, with a PhD as one possible
goal.

The program has also a strong international element which allows you
gain important experience from international collaborations in
science, with the opportunity to spend parts of the time spent on your
thesis work at research institutions abroad.
