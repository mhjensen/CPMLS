The <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/the-age-of-analytics-competing-in-a-data-driven-world" target="_blank">consulting company McKinsey recently released a report</a> arguing that the need for computational and data scientists &#8211; that is,
workers who can successfully analyze, model, and interpret data, and use it to inform critical business
decisions - is going to grow rapidly. A wide range of industries now use computational
modeling and data analytics to inform many aspects of their day-to-day practices, encompassing
a range of activities that include product design, optimizing manufacturing processes, hiring decisions,
and choosing advertising targets. The trend is clear, as are the implications for new employees
&#8211; being fluent in the tools used to work with data and computational models, as well as to be
intelligent consumers of the products of these tools, will be a critical and highly  demanded skillset.

The program is a collaboration between seven departments and classical disciplines:

<ul>
 <li> Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics</li>
 <li> Department of Biosciences</li>
 <li> Department of Chemistry</li>
 <li> Department of Geoscience</li>
 <li> Department of Informatics</li>
 <li> Department of Mathematics</li>
 <li> Department of Physics</li>

<h2 id="strategic-importance">Strategic importance </h2>

<p>
The program will educate the next generation of cross-disciplinary
science students with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to pose
and solve current and new scientific, technological and societal
challenges. The program will lay the foundation for cross-disciplinary
educational, research and innovation activities.

<p>
It is the first educational program to
comprehensively treat computation as the <em>triple junction</em> of
algorithm development and analysis, high performance computing, and
applications to scientific and engineering modeling and data
science. This approach recognizes computation as a new discipline
rather than being decentralized into isolated sub-disciplines. The CS program
will  will enable application-driven computational modeling
while also exposing disciplinary computational scientists to
advanced tools and techniques, which will ignite new
transformational connections in research and education.

<h2 id="vision-for-the-future-scientific-computing-and-data-science">Vision for the future: Scientific Computing and Data Science </h2>

<p>
Scientific computing focuses on the development of predictive computer
models of the world around us. As study of physical phenomena through
experimentation has become impossible, impractical and/or expensive,
computational modeling has become the primary tool for
understanding&#8212;equal in stature to analysis and experiment. 
The discipline of scientific computing
is the development of new methods that make challenging problems
tractable on modern computing platforms, providing scientists and
engineers with key windows into the world around us.

<p>
Data science focuses on the development of tools designed to find
trends within datasets that help scientists who are challenged with
massive amounts of data to assess key relations within those
datasets. These key relations provide hooks that allow scientists to
identify models which, in turn, facilitate making accurate predictions
in complex systems. For example, a key data science goal on the
biological side would be better care for patients (e.g., personalized
medicine). Given a patient&#8217;s genetic makeup, the proper data-driven
model would identify the most effective treatment for that patient.

<h2 id="aims-of-the-program">Aims of the program </h2>

<p>
A specific aim of this program is to develop your ability to pose and
solve problems that combine  insights from a specific discipline with mathematical tools
and computational skills. This provides a unique combination
of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable
for the development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs.
The main focus is not to educate computer
specialists, but to educate students with a solid understanding in basic science
as well as an integrated knowledge on how  to use
essential methods from computational science. This requires an
education that covers both the specific disciplines like physics, biology,
geoscience, mathematics etc with a strong background in computational science.

<p>
A significant aspect of this program is the ability to offer new educational
opportunities that are aligned with the needs of a 21st century
workforce. Many companies are seeking
individuals who have knowledge of both a specific discipline and
computational modeling.

<b>Applications of simulation</b>
<p>
Numerical simulations of various systems in science are central to our
basic understanding of nature and technlogy.
The increase in computational power,
improved algorithms for solving problems in science as well as access
to high-performance facilities, allow researchers nowadays to study
complicated systems across many length and energy scales. Applications
span from studying quantum physical systems in nanotechnology and the
characteristics of new materials or subamotic physics at its smallest
length scale, to simulating galaxies and the evolution of the universe.
In between, simulations are key to understanding
cancer treatment and how the brain works,
predicting climate changes and this week's weather,
simulating natural disasters, semi-conductor devices,
quantum computers, as well as assessing risk in the insurance and
financial industry. These are just a few topics
already well covered at the University of Oslo and that can be
topics for coming thesis projects as well as research directions.

Today's problems, unlike traditional
science and engineering, involve complex systems with many distinct

rely on a multi-disciplinary approach and therefore a need for
a multi-disciplinary educational program.

<p>
Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers
numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about
developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing
algorithmic thinking when solving problems.  Computing competence has
always been a central part of the science and engineering
education.

<p>
Modern computing competence is about

<ul>
<li> derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms</li>
<li> understanding what can go wrong with algorithms</li>
<li> overview of important, known algorithms</li>
<li> understanding how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems</li>
<li> reproducible science and ethics</li>
<li> algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems</li>

<h2 id="key-elements-in-computing-competence">Key elements in computing competence </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem
as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying
general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a
general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of
computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or
numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This
generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for
understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a
particular problem.

<p>
Computing competence represents a central element
in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to
essentially almost all advanced problems in modern
societies. Computing competence is simply central to further
progress. It enlarges the body of tools available to students and
scientists beyond classical tools and allows for a more generic
handling of problems. Focusing on algorithmic aspects results in
deeper insights about scientific problems.

Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems students learn
when working on their thesis projects are very similar to the methods
they will use in later stages of their careers.  To handle large
numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical
skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This
knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market.

<p>
Career opportunities are many, from research institutes, universities
and university colleges and a multitude of companies. Examples
include IBM, Hydro, Statoil, and Telenor.  The program gives an
excellent background for further studies, with a PhD as one possible
goal.
