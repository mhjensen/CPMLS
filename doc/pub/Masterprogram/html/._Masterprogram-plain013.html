<h2 id="___sec12">Description of learning outcomes </h2>

<p>
The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem
as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying
general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a
general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of
computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or
numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This
generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for
understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a
particular problem.

<p>
Computing competence represents a central element
in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to
essentially almost all advanced problems in modern
societies. Computing competence is simply central to further
progress. It enlarges the body of tools available to students and
scientists beyond classical tools and allows for a more generic
handling of problems. Focusing on algorithmic aspects results in
deeper insights about scientific problems.

<p>
The learning outcomes are subdivided in three general categories, knowledge, skills and general competence.

<ul>
<li> <b>Knowledge</b>: A candidate from this program</li>

<ul>
 <li> has deep knowledge of the scientific method and computational science at an advanced level, meaning that the candidate</li>

<ol>
 <li> has the ability to understand advanced scientific results in new fields</li>
 <li> has fundamental understanding of methods and tools</li>
 <li> can develop and apply advanced computational methods to scientific problems</li>

 <li> can plan and complete a research project</li>
 <li> can develop a scientific intuition and understanding that makes it possible to present and discuss scientific problems, results and uncertainties</li>
</ol>

 <li> is able to develop virtues, values and attitudes that lead to  a better understanding of ethical aspects of the scientific method, as well as promoting central aspects of the scientific method to society. This means for example that the candidate</li>

<ol>
 <li> can reflect on and develop strategies for making science reproducible and to promote the need for a proper ethical conduct</li>
 <li> has a deep understanding of the role basic and applied  research and computing play for progress in society</li>

 <li> can develop an understading of the role research and science can play together with industry and society in general</li>
 <li> can reflect over and develop learning strategies for life-long learning.</li>
</ol>

</ul>

</ul>

By completing a Master of Science thesis, the candidate will have developed a critical understanding of the scientific methods which have been studied, has a better understanding of the scientific process per se as well as having developed perspectives for future work and how to verify and validate scientific results.
