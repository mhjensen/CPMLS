===== Master program in Computational Science =====
!bblock

The program is a collaboration between seven departments and classical disciplines:
 
 * Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics
 * Department of Biosciences
 * Department of Chemistry
 * Department of Geoscience
 * Department of Informatics
 * Department of Mathematics
 * Department of Physics

The program is multidisciplinary and all students who have completed
undergraduate studies in science and engineering, with a sufficient
quantitative background, are eligible.

===== Strategic importance =====

The program will educate the next generation of cross-disciplinary
science students with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to pose
and solve current and new scientific, technological and societal
challenges. The program will lay the foundation for cross-disciplinary
educational, research and innovation activities.

It is the first educational program to
comprehensively treat computation as the *triple junction* of
algorithm development and analysis, high performance computing, and
applications to scientific and engineering modeling and data
science. This approach recognizes computation as a new discipline
rather than being decentralized into isolated sub-disciplines. The CS program
enable application-driven computational modeling
while also exposing disciplinary computational scientists to
advanced tools and techniques, which will ignite new
transformational connections in research and education.

===== The new program and the  CSE project  =====
!bblock

The new proposed program will also take a leading responsibility in further
developments of the highly successful "Computing in Science Education":"http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/" initiative at UiO.  Master of science thesis projects linked up to the CSE project will be offered. For future discussions: how to link with CCSE. 

If the program becomes successful, it will naturally lead to
new cross-disciplinary research. And perhaps for a new department
in computational science!!  Back to Hans Petter slides from 2005.

===== Double degrees: Some observations =====
!bblock From Brian O'Shea, Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering, Michigan State University

...Hi folks,

A substantial number of current nuclear theory grad students are thinking about pursuing a dual PhD in CMSE, and it seems that it’s becoming a useful recruiting tool elsewhere in the physics department.  I suspect it will be useful for nuclear theory as well.  To that end, a description of the CMSE PhD program, which is useful for explaining the value of a dual PhD, can be found "here":"https://cmse.msu.edu/academics/graduate-program/phd-in-computational-mathematics-science-and-engineering/"

And a description of the dual PhD can be found "here":"https://cmse.msu.edu/academics/graduate-program/dual-phd-in-computational-mathematics-science-and-engineering/".....

===== Double Master degree =====

* A typical Computational Physics student (now) writes a Masster thesis with a mix of theoretical physics (also with analysis of experimental data) and Computational science topics.
 * This is probably the case in all other fields and makes our education and candidates  attractive in the labor market.
* Set up detailed rules for double degrees, adding for example additional courses.


!split
===== Graduate Certificates, several possibilities  =====
Offer graduate certificates in
* Three of the courses with label CS-MATH  gives a certificate in Computational Modeling
* Three of the courses with label CS-PHYS gives a certificate in Computational Physics, Astrophysics, Chemistry, Materials Science  and Geoscience
* Three of the courses with label CS-BIO gives a certificate in Computational life science. 
* Three of the courses with label CS-INF gives a certificate in High-performance computing. 

!split
===== Further plans when established =====


* "Erasmus+":"https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/node_en", excellent opportunity to build up an international Master of Science program in Compuational Science, with stipends to studens from non-European countries 
* Doctoral school (national) and Marie Curie graduate training program in Computational Science
* Close ties with CCSE in the beginning, but long term plan is a new Department of Computational Science
 * An excellent example is the new  "Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering at Michigan State University":"https://cmse.msu.edu/"
   * 30 new positions, many of these shared with other departments
   * Undergraduate programs, from minor to major degrees
   * Graduate programs, MSc and PhD, dual degrees
   * new educational programs, but our new CS program is broader
 * Many similar departments in Northern America but few in Europe.
