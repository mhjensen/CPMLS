===  Update on website and courses ===

MHJ gave a brief review on the status of the website and courses. IN3200/4200 was still lacking a proper weblink. 

===  Admission criteria and application process ===

The admission criteria were revisited and discussed. Grete gave an
overview of the application process. The first wave of applicants
(deadline February) is composed of non-EU and non-nordic
applicants. The second wave of applicants (deadline in march) is
composed of EU citizens from outside the nordic countries and finally the third round has deadline April 15 and is 
composed of Nordic citizens or residents in nordic countries. 

The general impression from the first round of applicants, was that
the main bulk of these applicants (the majority from Asian countries)
were poorly qualified and presently none of the applicants could be
admitted. Average grades  were generally poor and most of them did not fulfill the admission criteria. 

=== Mentoring plan and criteria ===

We had a long discussion on setting up both a mentoring plan, criteria
for internal and external advisors as well as internal examiners.  The
aim was to arise the awareness about these topics, in particular in
light of the fact that the program is a multi-disciplinary one and
this may pose specific challenges to the selection of advisers and
examiners. Our learning outcomes have also a focus on computational
science aspects which may not be relevant for a more disciplinary
oriented field.  It was decided that this is adressed in more depth at
the next meeting, scheduled for the fall semester 2018, in particular
since MN-Fak is discussing common rules for all master of science
programs.

=== AOB ===

Plans for semester start were discussed.
