      "\n",
      "### Master program in Computational Physics, Mathematics and Life Science\n",
      "We propose a new Master of Science program at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the University of Oslo. This program is called  **Computational Physics, Mathematics and Life Science**, with acronym  **CPMLS** \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The program is a collaboration between four departments and classical disciplines:\n",
      "\n",
      " * Department of Biosciences\n",
      "\n",
      " * Department of Informatics\n",
      "\n",
      " * Department of Mathematics\n",
      "\n",
      " * Department of Physics\n",
      "\n",
      "The program will be administrated by the Department of Physics. \n",
      "The program is based on the highly successful Computational Physics direction under the present Master program\n",
      "in physics at the University of Oslo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The program is multidisciplinary and all students who have completed\n",
      "undergraduate studies in science and engineering, with a sufficient\n",
      "quantitative background, are eligible.  The language of instruction is\n",
      "English.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strategic importance\n",
      "\n",
      "The program will educate the next generation of cross-disciplinary\n",
      "science students with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to pose\n",
      "and solve current and new scientific, technological and societal\n",
      "challenges. The program will lay the foundation for cross-disciplinary\n",
      "educational, research and innovation activities at the Faculty. The\n",
      "program will contribute to building a common cross-disciplinary\n",
      "approach to the key strategic initiatives at the Faculty: Energy,\n",
      "Materials, Life Science, and Enabling Technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "A particular strength of physics students is their ability to pose and\n",
      "solve problems that combine physical insights with mathematical tools\n",
      "and now also computational skills. This provides a unique combination\n",
      "of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable \n",
      "for the development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs. \n",
      "In this program we build on and\n",
      "refine this philosophy.  The main focus is not to educate computer\n",
      "specialists, but to educate students with a solid understanding in basic science\n",
      "as well as an integrated knowledge on how  to use \n",
      "essential methods from computational science. This requires an\n",
      "education that covers both the specific disciplines likephysics, biology,\n",
      "geoscience, mathematics etcwith a strong background in computational science.\n",

      "The increase in computational power,\n",
      "improved algorithms for solving problems in science as well as access\n",
      "to high-performance facilities, allow researchers nowadays to study\n",
      "complicated systems across many length and energy scales. Applications\n",
      "span from studying quantum physical systems in nanotechnology and the\n",
      "characteristics of new materials or subamotic physics at its smallest\n",
      "length scale, to simulating galaxies and the evolution of the universe.\n",
      "In between, simulations are key to understanding\n",
      "cancer treatment and how the brain works,\n",
      "predicting climate changes and this week's weather,\n",
      "simulating natural disasters, semi-conductor devices,\n",
      "quantum computers, as well as assessing risk in the insurance and\n",
      "financial industry. These are just a few topics\n",

      "**Job market.**\n",
      "\n",
      "A large number of the candidates from the four involved departments\n",
      "get jobs where numerical simulations are central and essential. The proposed\n",

      "\n",
      "Today's problems, unlike traditional\n",
      "science and engineering, involve complex systems with many distinct\n",
      "physical processes. The wide open research topic of this century, both\n",
      "in industry and at universities, is how to effectively couple\n",
      "processes across different length and energy scales. Progress will\n",
