===== Master program in Computational Physics, Mathematics and Life Science =====
!bblock

The program is a collaboration between five departments and classical disciplines:

 * Department of Biosciences
 * Department of Chemistry
 * Department of Informatics
 * Department of Mathematics
 * Department of Physics

The program is multidisciplinary and all students who have completed
undergraduate studies in science and engineering, with a sufficient
quantitative background, are eligible.  The language of instruction is
English.

===== Agenda November 4, 2015, 10am-12pm =====
!bblock
Our main tasks are to discuss and agree on learning goals and competences as well as admission criteria. The deadline for the first _iteration_ to MN-fac is November 10. 

o Welcome and presentation of board members and invited guests, 15 min
o Overview of the material that has been developed and rationale for the program, 20 min
o Discussion of learning outcomes and competences, see material on "github address":"http://mhjensen.github.io/CPMLS/doc/pub/Masterprogram/html/Masterprogram.html", 40 min
o Discussions and topics to prepare for next meetings, 30 min
  * Thesis and research directions, preparing documentation and pool of potential supervisors
  * New members from Department of Mathematics
  * Integrating the program with NMBU
  * Exisiting Courses and courses/modules to be developed 
o Additional topics

===== Some overarching topics =====
!bblock
* Numerical simulations of various systems in science are central to our basic understanding of nature and technlogy. UiO is very strong on computational science. A dedicated master program will send strong signals to new students.
* To build up an activity in computational life science
* Develop new research directions in computational science with a _focus on multiscale science and cross-disciplinary research_
* Strengthen the CSE initiative
* Some of us have a wider agenda, a new department in Computational Science, along the lines of that developed at "Michigan State University":"http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2015/new-department-advances-computational-science-research-education/"

===== Integrating with NMBU =====
!bblock Two paths:

* A common program, owned by UiO and NMBU. Students apply locally and register their credits locally but can have supervisors and take courses from both universities. The degree is awarded locally. This is most likely the simplest path. 
* A cotutelle program, with the same modalities as above but common degrees. This is more difficult and UiO has not been very keen about cotutelle agreements at the MSc level or PhD level.

* Computational chemistry
* Computational physics
* Computational materials science
* Computational life science
* Image analysis and signal processing
* Computational finance and statistics   (NEED people here)
