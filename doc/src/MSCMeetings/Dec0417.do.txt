===== Practicalities to finalize ===== 
!bblock 
 o We need to select stand-ins (varamedlemmer). It is natural that each representative has her/his stand-in.
 o Norwegian texts almost done. The mn-fak admin will review our texts this week. As soon as they are done, we should carefully review them again. 
 o The English texts are at http://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/computational-science-master/index.html

Feel free to review again the content of the website. The Norwegian
website will be made public most likely towards the end of this week.

===== Discussion of courses ===== 
!bblock 
An important aspect of this program is to be  able to build a true inter-disciplinary program. The easiest things to start with are our present courses and whether they can live up to  our scientific and educational  needs. 

* Compulsory courses
  o "FYS-MAT3155/4155 Data analysis ad Machine learning with numerical projects":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/MachineLearning", Fall semester?
  o "MAT-IN3110 Introduction to numerical analysis":"http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/MAT-IN3110/", Fall semester?
  o IN3XXX/4XXX High-performance computing with numerical projects, slides from Xing Cai's talk last time are included with this mail. Spring semester? 

Knut gave a summary of MAT-IN3110 last time. This course may need revisions in order to fit properly our needs.

===== AOB: Discussion of larger initiative on Computational Science at UiO  ===== 
!bblock 
 * I would like to propose that we try to establish a new initiative at UiO called _Computing across the Disciplines_
   o Can be established as a center
   o It could coordinate education and research initiatives across disciplines. Our program fits excellently here
   o It can have strong ties with the recently established center of excellence on computing in science education
   o Unleash new research funds for computational science research
More material will presented during the meeting, if time allows.
