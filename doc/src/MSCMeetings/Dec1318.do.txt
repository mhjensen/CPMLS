===== Present status, students enlisted and review, summary & experiences from the fall semester =====
What has been done:
o Biweekly seminars for all CS students (six in total), gaming evenings and social gatherings with food and refreshments. Last event November 23, Anne Solberg talked about Machine Learning at UiO
o Meeting all students  with program chair once per semester in order to get input on status, procedures etc. 
o Individual mentoring if wanted/needed (10 students used this option) with program chair
o Close contact via compulsory courses (most students, 29,  follow FYS-STK4155) 
o 36 students enlisted, two new after semester start and two who have left (one maternity leave). Thus we have 36 active students with three whose status is unknown to program chair
o First week not optimal at all departments

For students who struggle, "ForVei":"https://www.mn.uio.no/studier/forvei/" is an excellent counseling unit at MN-Fak.

===== Routines for the program, administrative issues, regulations, selection of internal and external examiners etc =====
o See the attached documents from MN-fak, we will go through these first.
o We all agreed to preserve  a local autonomy, students from each study option are enlisted at the department where the study option belongs. 

Our program is however a multidisciplinary one, with learning outcomes
and thesis topics which may not be familiar to faculty at a given
department.  Furthermore, since this is a cross-department program, we
need to make sure that students in this program feel they are treated
equally, or as far as this is possible. This applies to



!split
===== Routines for the program, administrative issues, regulations, selection of internal and external examiners etc =====
We need thus to strike a balance between the _autonomy_ of the given
department and study option and the needs and learning outcomes of our
program.  And the wishes of our students. 

Furthermore, we will encounter (five this year) situations
where students may opt for external advisors and thesis topics which
do not fall into the thematics of a given study option. We need to
discuss these issues as well and make sure that our rules are flexible
enough to allow for such cases.

!split 
===== Internal examiners and advisors =====

!bblock  Proposal to be added to MN-fak rules
o Internal examiners do not need to come from the same department where the study option resides and where the student is enlisted. Internal examiners come from a pool of CS competent scientists with knowledge of the central fields covered by the program
o Strive as far as possible to allow for thesis topics which may not match (partly or fully) the scientific profile of a given study option.

!split 
===== Internal examiners, criteria for discussion  =====
Internal examiners are chosen by the program board to follow the following disciplinary topics (in addition to the specific study options)
as well as having competences in software development. An internal examiner 
o Machine learning and possibly AI (all study options)
o Statistics and data analysis (all study options)
o Differential equations (partial and ordinary, applies to all study options)
o Software development (all study options)
o Computational quantum mechanics (physics, chemistry, and materials science)
o Computational statistical mechanics (physics, chemistry and material science)
o Computational Life Science (most study options)
o Computational Geoscience
o Bioinformatics
o Stochastic simulations (most study options)

Too many? Missing topics? too generic or too specific? 

!split
===== A minimalistic Mentoring program =====
!bblock
o Program chair discusses with all students from a given study options at least once per semester the first year.  This is done groupwise with the possibility to have one-to-one meetings. If possible, representatives from the pertinent study options could participate. 
o In addition to the contact person for every study option, the student gets a mentor for the first year of study. The mentor can be a faculty member, a post-doc or a PhD student.  
!eblock
When the student has embarked on her/his Master thesis topic, MSc thesis supervisor becomes the mentor. 

!bblock Role of mentor
o Organize at least once per semester (first year of study) a meeting with the student
!eblock

Students should be able to choose from a list of possible mentors according to scientific interests. We should develop a training program for mentors in collaboration with MN-fak.
