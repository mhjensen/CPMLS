# FYS4447/9447 – Advanced machine learning and data analysis for the physical sciences


### Level Master and PhD
### Credits 10
### Teaching spring semester
### Examination Every Spring
### Teaching language Norwegian (English on request)


## Course content

Advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning methods provide
tools that have broad applicability in scientific research.  These
techniques are being applied across the diversity of research topics
in modern science, leading to advances that will facilitate scientific
discoveries and societal applications.  This course focuses on
advanced machine learning and statistical learning methods applied to
a broad variety of problems in the physical sciences and life science,
from computational neuroscience to the analysis of high-energy physics
experiments.  Supervised and unsupervised learning methods are
discussed, spanning from various deep learning methods to Bayesian modeling. 


After this course you should :

- be familiar with central deep learning methods and how to use them in actual research
- be familiar with advanced regression algorithms
- understand how to to simulate complex physical processes with many degrees of freedom
- understand optimization techniques and their fundamental role in machine learning
- be familiar with Bayesian statistics and Bayesian Machine Learning
- understand how to find correlations in data sets and quantify uncertainties

## Admission

Students admitted at UiO must apply for courses in
Studentweb. Students enrolled in other Master's Degree Programmes can,
on application, be admitted to the course if this is cleared by their
own study programme.

Nordic citizens and applicants residing in the Nordic countries may
apply to take this course as a single course student.

If you are not already enrolled as a student at UiO, please see our
information about admission requirements and procedures for
international applicants.

## Prerequisites

Recommended previous knowledge

A good background in mathematics is needed.

Other recommended courses are:

FYS-STK4155 – Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning


## Overlapping courses
None


## Teaching

The course is based on assigned self studies and three projects. There are no regular lectures. Meetings every week (lasting two hours) are arranged in order to monitor progress and discuss projects and exercises.

## Examination

Three project assignments that each is given a weight of 1/3 in the final grading (100% together).
There is no final exam.


### Examination support material

No examination support material is allowed.

## Language of examination

You may write your examination papers in Norwegian, Swedish, Danish or English.

## Grading scale

Grades are awarded on a scale from A to F, where A is the best grade and F is a fail. Read more about the grading system. For PhD students it is only pass/not passed.
