===== Master program in Computational Physics, Mathematics and Life Science =====
!bblock

The program is a collaboration between five departments and classical disciplines:

 * Department of Biosciences
 * Department of Chemistry
 * Department of Informatics
 * Department of Mathematics
 * Department of Physics


_The program is truly multidisciplinary_ and all students who have completed
undergraduate studies in science and engineering, with a sufficient
quantitative background, are eligible.

===== The new program combines old and new initiatives =====
!bblock

This program builds on the strengths and successes of two existing Master of Science programs/directions at the University of Oslo, namely the 
 * Computational Physics (at the Dept. of Physics) and
 * Applied Mathematics and Mechanics (at the Dept. of Mathematics).

These programs/study directions  were established in 2003.
Based on the experience from these programs, the hope is that the proposed program can enlarge the reach of disciplines where computations play and/or are expected to play  a large. In particular, new directions 
in Computational Life Science need to  be developed to
meet coming needs of the scientific community. We believe this new direction is
best developed in close collaboration with already successful
computational science programs.  


!eblock


!split
===== Thesis directions =====
!bblock
The program aims at offering thesis projects in a variety of fields. These are

===== Strategic importance =====
!bblock
* The program will educate the next generation of cross-disciplinary science students with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to pose and solve current and new scientific, technological and societal challenges. 
* The program will lay the foundation for cross-disciplinary educational, research and innovation activities at the Faculty. 
* The program will contribute to building a common cross-disciplinary approach to the key strategic initiatives at the Faculty: Energy, Materials, Life Science, and Enabling Technologies.

===== Strategic importance =====
!bblock
A specific aim of this program is to develop the students' ability to pose and
solve problems that combine physical insights with mathematical tools
and computational skills. This provides a unique combination
of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable
for the development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs.

===== Scientific and educational motivation =====

!bblock 
* Numerical simulations of various systems in science are central to our basic understanding of nature and technlogy.
* The increase in computational power, improved algorithms for solving problems in science as well as access to high-performance facilities, allow researchers nowadays to study complicated systems across many length and energy scales. 

Applications span from studying 
 * quantum physical systems in nanotechnology and the characteristics of new materials or subamotic physics at its smallest length scale, to simulating galaxies and the evolution of the universe.
 * In between, simulations are key to understanding cancer treatment and how the brain works,
 * predicting climate changes and this week's weather,
 * simulating natural disasters, semi-conductor devices,
 * quantum computers, 
 * as well as assessing risk in the insurance and financial industry. 

These are just a few topics
already well covered at the University of Oslo and that can be
topics for coming thesis projects as well as research directions.

===== The new program will also host the CSE project =====
!bblock

* The new proposed program will also take a leading responsibility in further developments of the highly successful "Computing in Science Education":"http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/" initiative at UiO.  
* Master of science thesis projects linked up to the CSE project will be offered.

!split
===== Computing competence =====
!bblock
Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers
numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about
developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing
algorithmic thinking when solving problems.  Computing competence has
always been a central part of the science and engineering
education.

Modern computing competence is about

* derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms
* understanding what can go wrong with algorithms
* overview of important, known algorithms
* understanding how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems
* reproducible science and ethics
* algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems

exciting thesis projects from many disciplines: biology and life
science, chemistry, mathematics, informatics, physics, geophysics,
mechanics, geology, computational finance, computational informatics, b
ig data analysis, digital signal processing
and image analysis – the candidates select research field according to
their interests.

The table here is an example of a suggested path for a Master of Science project,
with course work the first year and thesis work the last year.

===== Structure and specialized modules  =====
!bblock
The program allows also for replacing regular courses with specialized modules of shorter duration.
These modules will be developed by the program committee but can also be developed in an ad hoc basis
and tailored to the individual projects.

===== The program opens up for flexible backgrounds  =====

!bblock
While discipline-based master's programs tend to introduce very strict
requirements to courses, we believe in adapting a computational thesis
topic to the student's background, thereby opening up for
students with a wide range of bachelor's degrees.
A very heterogeneous student community is thought to be a strength and
unique feature of this program.

===== Career prospects =====

!bblock
Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems students learn
when working on their thesis projects are very similar to the methods
they will use in later stages of their careers.  To handle large
numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical
skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This
knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market.
