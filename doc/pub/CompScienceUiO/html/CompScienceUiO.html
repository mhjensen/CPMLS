<h2 id="vision-for-the-future-scientific-computing-and-data-science">Vision for the future: Scientific Computing and Data Science </h2>

<p>Scientific computing focuses on the development of predictive computer
models of the world around us. As study of physical phenomena through
experimentation has become impossible, impractical and/or expensive,
computational modeling has become the primary tool for
understanding&#8212;equal in stature to analysis and experiment. 
The discipline of scientific computing
is the development of new methods that make challenging problems
tractable on modern computing platforms, providing scientists and
engineers with key windows into the world around us.
</p>

<p>Data science focuses on the development of tools designed to find
trends within datasets that help scientists who are challenged with
massive amounts of data to assess key relations within those
datasets. These key relations provide hooks that allow scientists to
identify models which, in turn, facilitate making accurate predictions
in complex systems. For example, a key data science goal on the
biological side would be better care for patients (e.g., personalized
medicine). Given a patient&#8217;s genetic makeup, the proper data-driven
model would identify the most effective treatment for that patient.

<h2 id="aims-of-the-program">Aims of the program </h2>

<p>A specific aim of this program is to develop your ability to pose and
solve problems that combine  insights from a specific discipline with mathematical tools
and computational skills. This provides a unique combination
of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable
for the development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs.
The main focus is not to educate computer
specialists, but to educate students with a solid understanding in basic science
as well as an integrated knowledge on how  to use
essential methods from computational science. This requires an
education that covers both the specific disciplines like physics, biology,
geoscience, mathematics etc with a strong background in computational science.
</p>

<p>A significant aspect of this program is the ability to offer new educational
opportunities that are aligned with the needs of a 21st century
workforce. Many companies are seeking
individuals who have knowledge of both a specific discipline and
computational modeling.

<p>Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems students learn
when working on their thesis projects are very similar to the methods

<h2 id="types-of-machine-learning">Types of machine learning </h2>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<p>The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In <em>supervised learning</em> we know the answer to a problem,
and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, <em>unsupervised learning</em>
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.
Some authours also operate with a third category, namely <em>reinforcement learning</em>. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.
</p>

<p>Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.
Some of the most common tasks are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.</li>
  <li> Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.</li>
  <li> Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<!-- !split -->
<h2 id="examples">Examples </h2>

<p>The large amount of degrees of freedom pertain to both theory and experiment in the physical sciences. With increasingly complicated experiments that produce large amounts data, automated classification of events becomes increasingly important. Here, deep learning methods offer a plethora of interesting research avenues. </p>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Reconstruction of particle trajectories or classification of events are typical examples where ML methods are being used. However, since these data can often be extremely noisy, the precision necessary for discovery in physics requires algorithmic improvements. Research along such directions, interfacing nuclear and particle physics with AI/ML is expected to play a significant role in physics discoveries related to new facilities.  The treatment of corrupted data in imaging and image processing is also a relevant topic.</li> 
<li> Design of detectors represents an important area of applications for ML/AI methods in nuclear physics.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<!-- !split -->
<h2 id="and-more">And more   </h2>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<ul>
<li> An important application of AI/ML methods is to improve the estimation of bias or uncertainty due to the introduction of or lack of physical constraints in various theoretical models.</li>
<li> In theory, we expect to use AI/ML algorithms and methods to improve our knowledge about  correlations of physical model parameters in data for quantum many-body systems. Deep learning methods show great promise in circumventing the exploding dimensionalities encountered in quantum mechanical many-body studies.</li> 
<li> Merging a frequentist approach (the standard path in ML theory) with a Bayesian approach, has the potential to infer better probabilitity distributions and error estimates. As an example, methods for fast Monte-Carlo- based Bayesian computation of nuclear density functionals show great promise in providing a better understanding</li> 
<li> Machine Learning and Quantum Computing is a very interesting avenue to explore. See for example talk of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WPKv1Q57os&list=PLUPPQ1TVXK7uHwCTccWMBud-zLyvAf8A2&index=5&ab_channel=ECTstar" target="_self">Sofia Vallecorsa</a>.</li>

<b></b>
<p>
<p>Almost every problem in ML and data science starts with the same ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li> The dataset \( \mathbf{x} \) (could be some observable quantity of the system we are studying)</li>
<li> A model which is a function of a set of parameters \( \mathbf{\alpha} \) that relates to the dataset, say a likelihood  function \( p(\mathbf{x}\vert \mathbf{\alpha}) \) or just a simple model \( f(\mathbf{\alpha}) \)</li>
<li> A so-called <b>loss/cost/risk</b> function \( \mathcal{C} (\mathbf{x}, f(\mathbf{\alpha})) \) which allows us to decide how well our model represents the dataset.</li> 
</ul>
<p>We seek to minimize the function \( \mathcal{C} (\mathbf{x}, f(\mathbf{\alpha})) \) by finding the parameter values which minimize \( \mathcal{C} \). This leads to  various minimization algorithms. It may surprise many, but at the heart of all machine learning algortihms there is an optimization problem. </p>

<ol>
<li> Lots of conceptual learning: superposition, entanglement, QIS applications, etc.</li>
<li> Coding is indispensable. That is why this should be a part of a CS/DS program</li>
<li> Teamwork, project management, and communication are important and highly valued</li>
<li> Engagement with industry: guest lectures, virtual tours, co-ops, and/or internships.</li>

<h2 id="future-needs-problems-us-observations-mostly-but-transfer-most-likely-to-europe-as-well">Future Needs/Problems (US observations mostly but transfer most likely to Europe as well) </h2>

<ol>
<li> There are already (USA) great needs for specialized people (Ph. D. s, postdocs), but also needs of  people with a broad overview of what is possible in QIS.</li>
<li> There are not enough potential employees in QIS (USA). It is a supply gap, not a skills gap.</li>
<li> A BSc with specialization  is a good place to start</li>
<li> It is tremendously important to get everyone speaking the same language. Facility with the vernacular of quantum mechanics is a big plus.</li>
<li> There is a huge list of areas where technical expertise may be important. But employers are often more concerned with attributes like project management, working well in a team, interest in the field, and adaptability than in specific technical skills.</li>
