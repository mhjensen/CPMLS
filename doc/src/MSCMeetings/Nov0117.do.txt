===== Composition of Board =====
!bblock
 o Alternative 1: Every study option is represented in the board, this means 10 members, plus 1-2 administrative members and 2-3 students, roughly 15 members
 o Alternative 2: Each department has only one member (not all study directions will be represented then). This limits the board to seven members,   1-2   administrative members and 2 student members, in total approximately 10 members

I would also like to propose that we keep the working group as an additional forum for the program board. We can let the working group members have the right to meet and come with proposals but perhaps limit voting rights to board members only.
