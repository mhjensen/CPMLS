===== Present status, students enlisted and review, summary & experiences from the fall semester =====

MHJ gave an overview of what has been. He presented also a list of present students. 
 
What has been done:
o Biweekly seminars for all CS students (six in total), gaming evenings and social gatherings with food and refreshments. Last event November 23, Anne Solberg talked about Machine Learning at UiO
o Meeting all students  with program chair once per semester in order to get input on status, procedures etc. 
o Individual mentoring if wanted/needed (10 students used this option) with program chair
o Close contact via compulsory courses (most students, 29,  follow FYS-STK4155) 
o 36 students enlisted, two new after semester start and two who have left (one maternity leave). Thus we have 36 active students with three whose status is unknown to program chair. They have not responded to emails.
o First week not optimal at all departments

For students who struggle, "ForVei":"https://www.mn.uio.no/studier/forvei/" is an excellent counseling unit at MN-Fak.

===== Routines for the program, administrative issues, regulations, selection of internal and external examiners etc =====

o The work of the MN-fak committee (attached documents from MN-fak) was discussed and most points were agreed upon
o We all agreed to preserve  a local autonomy, students from each study option are enlisted at the department where the study option belongs. 

Our program is however a multidisciplinary one, with learning outcomes
and thesis topics which may not be familiar to faculty at a given
department.  Furthermore, since this is a cross-department program, we
need to make sure that students in this program feel they are treated
equally, or as far as this is possible. It was agreed that this should apply to all study options. 




===== Routines for the program, administrative issues, regulations, selection of internal and external examiners etc =====
We need thus to strike a balance between the _autonomy_ of the given
department and study option and the needs and learning outcomes of our
program.  And the wishes of our students. 



Furthermore, we will encounter (five this year) situations
where students may opt for external advisors and thesis topics which
do not fall into the thematics of a given study option. We need to
discuss these issues as well and make sure that our rules are flexible
enough to allow for such cases.

The program board discussed extensively how to choose internal examiners. The board decided to continue this discussion at the next meeting. 

===== Internal examiners and advisors =====

Proposal to be added to MN-fak rules
o Internal examiners do not need to come from the same department where the study option resides and where the student is enlisted. Internal examiners come from a pool of CS competent scientists with knowledge of the central fields covered by the program
o Strive as far as possible to allow for thesis topics which may not match (partly or fully) the scientific profile of a given study option. 




===== Internal examiners, criteria for discussion  =====

Internal examiners are chosen by the program board to follow the following disciplinary topics (in addition to the specific study options)
as well as having competences in software development. An internal examiner 
o Machine learning and possibly AI (all study options)
o Statistics and data analysis (all study options)
o Differential equations (partial and ordinary, applies to all study options)
o Software development (all study options)
o Computational quantum mechanics (physics, chemistry, and materials science)
o Computational statistical mechanics (physics, chemistry and material science)
o Computational Life Science (most study options)
o Computational Geoscience
o Bioinformatics
o Stochastic simulations (most study options)

This discussion will be taken up at the next meeting.

===== Thesis topics that do not align well with study options =====

We have now four students who have chosen thesis topics (see list above) that do not match fully their respective study options. Since the program aims at being an interdisciplinary one, we may encounter several such cases. Andreas A mentioned that at IFI situations like these have been discussed several times, in particular since students may opt for thesis topics under study options where the admission criteria (in particular due to ranking based on marks) have been more difficult. The board agreed that we should minimize such possibilities. 
On the other hand we need also as a program to open up for a certain flexibility. 

The board did not conclude on this, but several of its members pointed
out that one should limit the possibility of choosing thesis topics
that are not aligned with the specific study option. One possibility
is to express this clearly on the websites of each study option.

After the meeting, new inputs from MN-fak was sent about this
topic. This will be sent out to the board members asap. 

The board has however not concluded yet. This topic will be
discussed in more detail at the next meeting.

===== A minimalistic Mentoring program =====

o Program chair discusses with all students from a given study options at least once per semester the first year.  This is done groupwise with the possibility to have one-to-one meetings. If possible, representatives from the pertinent study options could participate. 
o In addition to the contact person for every study option, the student gets a mentor for the first year of study. The mentor can be a faculty member, a post-doc or a PhD student.  

When the student has embarked on her/his Master thesis topic, MSc thesis supervisor becomes the mentor. 

Role of mentor
o Organize at least once per semester (first year of study) a meeting with the student

Students should be able to choose from a list of possible mentors according to scientific interests. We should develop a training program for mentors in collaboration with MN-fak.


It was agreed that the next meeting (February 2019) should address
o Internal examiners and a pool of supervisors, as well as come with feedback to MN-fak
o Develop rules for students that end up with thesis topics not fully aligned with the study option.
o Details about the mentoring program.

The meeting ended at 12pm. There were no topics for AOB.
